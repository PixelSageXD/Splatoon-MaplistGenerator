# Splatoon Maplist Generator
A lightweight maplist generator for Splatoon 3 (primarily used for scrims in the comp community) made using a single Python program!  
I basically just made this over the course of a few days to help me make maplists quickly without worrying about playing popular maps or repeating maps too often.  
The program is weighted to use more popular maps first, while limiting repeated maps or mapmodes until it absolutely has to - this means you shouldn't be getting many repeats too close to each other (if this happens you can of course just run the program again though)  

## How to Use

This is really simple - just download the `Set-Maplist-Generator.py` file from the latest release then run it.  
It should open in some sort of command prompt window and you will be able to do all the inputs and get the correct output.  
If there are formatting errors or it doesn't work, then download an IDE/code editor like IDLE or VSCode and run the file inside those.  

## Suggestions?

Let me know!! I just made this as a silly project but I'd love to continue updating this for all of the needs of the comp Splatoon community :)  
I'm sure this program won't need editing for a while, but any bug reporting or feature ideas would be great.  

## Why not use Sendou?

I felt like making this program so you should use it.  
More seriously - I felt like there were a few functions that would be nice to have in my own program (choosing exactly how many games of each mode, having weighted randomness, etc.)
